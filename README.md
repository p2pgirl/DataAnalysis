# DataAnalysis - Read Me!
Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data and py info.
This particular project takes an XML file, cleans up the data using Python, then parses various information into dictionaries.  It then outputs to csv files.  Those csv files are imported into SQL where queries are run and data evaluation is made. (keep reading! More below)

The OSM file: sample.osm - a sample of the data I used to test with

The py files:
WrangleOpenStreetMapData-Project.py contains all the py files of the entire Jupyter Notebook.
For the other py files: mapparser.py, tags.py, users.py, audit.py, and data.py: these py files are all from the case study, NOT the final project
